      Create a routing enabled Angular app to demonstrate the routing between 2
      static components. Create one component named as “First” and another named
      as “Second”. Define the routes for the 2 components using the “Routes”
      array. Add the route links in the “app” component with “routesLink”.
      Lastly add “router-outlet/router-outlet” to render the components for the
      selected route.
